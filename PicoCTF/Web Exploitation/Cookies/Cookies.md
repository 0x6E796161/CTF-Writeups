## Description

Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one.Â [http://mercury.picoctf.net:29649/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:29649/)

## Hints

none

## Approach

I looked up the sites cookies and i saw a single cookie with value -1, i changed it to one but then i forgot to reload the page...
i then typed in snickerdoodle and and this point i should have looked at the cookies value again, but i didnt for some reason. I was busy thinking too hard about what name i should try to put in next.. 

After a while i booted up burp suite to check more closely what data the site was sending but i still ignored the cookie value, i really dont know why. I tried various other things but they didnt work.

In the end i did notice that putting in snickerdoodle made the cookie value change from -1 to 0, but since i already "tried" to change the value and it didnt work ( again thats cuz i didnt reload lol). 

I tried to send requests with curl with that didnt work either so i kind of gave up and looked at a write up of [vivian-dai](https://github.com/vivian-dai/PicoCTF2021-Writeup/blob/main/Web%20Exploitation/Cookies/Cookies.md). I then noticed my mistake of not reloading and quickly saw that the message changed if i changed the value of the cookie.

# Solution

1. (on chrome) Open up dev tools in the browser and go to Application tab, on the left side select cookies and double click on the value then change it to 18 (1-17 were flavor text)
