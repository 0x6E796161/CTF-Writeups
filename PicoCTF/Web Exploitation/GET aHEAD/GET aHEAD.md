## Description

Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competitionÂ [http://mercury.picoctf.net:34561/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:34561/)

## Hints

1. Maybe you have more than 2 choices
2. Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at the responses

## Approach

1. I couldnt see anything interesting on the website or its source so i opened Burpsuite to intercept the requests.
2. i went to the proxy tab > intercept and turned intercept on so i could see the traffic ![./Pasted image 20230322161210.png]
3. I looked at the requests and there was a difference between pressing the blue and the red button, which is the **HTTP request method** used. 
   Pressing the Red button makes use of the **GET method** and pressing the Blue button makes use of the **POST method**.

1. the name of the CTF is GET aHEAD, and we already saw a GET method. By looking into the [HTTP request methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) we can see that theres a HEAD method. So we will try to request the header of the website instead.
2. i used curl to send a HEAD request to the website by using this command 
	``curl -I http://mercury.picoctf.net:34561/index.php?``
and it returned the flag
