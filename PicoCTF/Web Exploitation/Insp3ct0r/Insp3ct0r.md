## Description

Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:41511

## Hints

1. How do you inspect web code on a browser?
2. There's 3 parts

## Approach

1. I opened the website and inspected the body to find the first part of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3
2. I went to the Sources tab in DevTools to find the css file, inside was the 2nd part of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t
3. the last part was in the js file: _lucky?832b0699}

wow this took 2 minutes compared to the one i did just now (cookies) and awarded more points, but well i did make a really simple mistake there.


## Flag

```
picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?832b0699}
