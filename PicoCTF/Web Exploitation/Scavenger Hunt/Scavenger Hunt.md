# Scavenger Hunt
*note* once again i took hints from the writeup of [vivian-dai](https://github.com/vivian-dai) , im very thankful to you for writing them.  
## Overview

Points: 50
Category: Web Exploitation,picoCTF 2021

## Description

There is some interesting information hidden around this siteÂ [http://mercury.picoctf.net:39698/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:39698/). Can you find it?

## Hints

1. You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

## Approach

1. Checking the html file gets us the first part: picoCTF{t
2. 2nd part is in the css file: h4ts_4_l0
3. the js file gives us a hint: "How can I keep Google from indexing my website?"
4. to disallow indexing you have to set up a robots.txt file in the root directory
5. so we go to ``http://mercury.picoctf.net:39698/robots.txt`` to find the 3rd part: t_0f_pl4c
6. in the robots.txt is the next hint: "# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?"
<details> <summary>Me ranting because i need to look at another write up</summary> <p>okay so i looked around the internet and i tried to get info on the apache server with cURL again, but i couldnt find any info like the version of the apache server. 
actually i couldnt even find traces that the site was an apache server. I dont want to try to exploit any vulnerabilites anyway because im not sure if i should.. oh well time to look at the write up </p> </details> 

7. welp i tried to look up the root directory of an apache server but httpd.conf didnt work, i shouldve looked further..
8. anyway the solution was the config file .htaccess in which the 4th part was written. 
   Heres the full adress ``http://mercury.picoctf.net:39698/.htaccess`` and the 4th part: 3s_2_lO0k
9. the next hint is: "I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there." 
<details> <summary>Another rant</summary> <p>Storing information on mac huh, i really have no idea how to even start looking for the answer to this one. I guess i really just need a lot more experience and knowledge to intuitively know what to do? i dont know</p> </details> 

10. wow, i tried the root directories of the mac but i guess i shouldve just googled "Mac Store file" because thats the answer i got from the writeup. Maybe im thinking too hard on these beginner ctfs or maybe im just dumb. Nonetheless im not gonna give up and try to learn everything.
11. By googling Mac Store file you get the .DS_Store file format which you can put into the url to get the last part of the flag: _fa04427c}


## Flag

```
picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_fa04427c}
```
