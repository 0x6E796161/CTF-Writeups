## Hints

none

## Approach

1. I checked the chrome dev tools and found the flag in the Sources tab in the wasm(web assembly) folder in file named a784ba16. This was def not the right way i feel like.
2. indeed, i checked the write up of [Dvd848](https://github.com/Dvd848/CTFs/blob/master/2021_picoCTF/Some_Assembly_Required_1.md) and it seems like the wasm script was auto converted by chrome. In any case thank you Dvd for the explanation on wasm ill probably need it in the future.


## Flag
