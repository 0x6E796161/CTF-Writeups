## Description

Can you find the robots? `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:36474

## Hints

1. What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Approach

1. through the name and hint we can guess that we need to check the robots.txt of the site.
2. inside the robots.txt we see this line: ``Disallow: /477ce.html`` 
3. so we go to the url ``https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/477ce.html`` and the flag is right there


## Flag

```
picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_477ce}
